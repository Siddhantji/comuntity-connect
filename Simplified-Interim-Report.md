## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Community Connect project addresses the need for a cost-effective online platform that connects volunteers with community projects for non-profit organizations. This web application leverages AWS free tier services to provide essential functionality at zero operational cost, focusing on volunteer registrations, project listings, and volunteer selection of projects.

The proposed solution utilizes a modern technology stack including Next.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend API, and MongoDB Atlas for database management. Key AWS services integrated include EC2 for hosting and S3 for file storage. The platform features user registration, project browsing, and basic search functionality to facilitate volunteer engagement.

The architecture is designed to operate within free tier limitations while maintaining functionality and security. The solution focuses on the core requirements: volunteer registration system, project listing capabilities, and project selection features. Cost analysis indicates the platform can operate at zero cost using free tier services, making it accessible to resource-constrained non-profit organizations.

**Importance and Relevance:**

The chosen technology stack addresses the core requirements for the volunteer matching platform:

1. **Unified Language Ecosystem**: JavaScript across the entire stack reduces development complexity and enables faster development cycles, crucial for a college project with time constraints.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: All technologies are open-source with no licensing costs, aligning with the project's cost-conscious objectives.

3. **AWS Integration**: Excellent compatibility with AWS services, particularly EC2 deployment and S3 file storage.

**Advantages and Benefits:**

**MongoDB Advantages:**
- Flexible document-based schema ideal for user profiles with varying information
- Free tier availability through MongoDB Atlas aligning with cost constraints
- Simple integration with Node.js applications
- Suitable for small to medium-scale applications

**Next.js Benefits:**
- Server-side rendering improving performance and SEO
- Built-in optimization features reducing development time
- Strong community support and documentation
- Easy deployment and production readiness

**Node.js and Express.js Strengths:**
- Lightweight and efficient for web applications
- Rich ecosystem of packages reducing development complexity
