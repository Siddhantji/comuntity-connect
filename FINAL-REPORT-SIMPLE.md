# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background Information

Non-profit organizations and community groups worldwide face significant challenges in effectively connecting volunteers with meaningful community projects. The traditional approach to volunteer recruitment and management relies heavily on manual processes, paper-based registrations, and word-of-mouth communications. This fragmented methodology creates multiple barriers to effective volunteer engagement and limits the potential social impact of community initiatives.

The current landscape reveals several critical inefficiencies. Organizations often lack centralized systems to advertise volunteer opportunities, resulting in limited reach within their communities. Potential volunteers struggle to discover projects that align with their skills and interests. The administrative burden of managing volunteer applications diverts valuable resources away from core mission activities.

These challenges become particularly acute for smaller non-profit organizations operating with limited budgets and staff resources. Commercial volunteer management software solutions typically require substantial financial investments through subscription fees that exceed the budgets of resource-constrained community organizations.

Community Connect emerges as a response to these challenges, providing a web-based platform specifically designed to facilitate connections between volunteers and community projects while maintaining complete cost-effectiveness. The platform addresses the core pain points: volunteer discovery, streamlined registration, project listing management, and basic communication—all delivered through an intuitive web interface accessible from any modern browser.

The project leverages the power of cloud computing and modern web technologies to create a scalable solution that operates entirely within AWS free tier limitations. By strategically utilizing Amazon EC2 for compute resources, S3 for file storage, and MongoDB Atlas for database management, the platform achieves zero operational costs during the development and initial deployment phases.
